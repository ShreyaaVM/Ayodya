    <h2>Deity</h2>
        <p>am Lalla Virajman, the infant form of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the temple.[56] Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol.[57] Ram Lalla was a litigant in the court case over the disputed site in 1989, being considered a "juristic person" by the law.[2] He was represented by Triloki Nath Pandey, a senior VHP leader who was considered Ram Lalla's closest 'human' friend</p>
